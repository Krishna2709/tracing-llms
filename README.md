Tracing LLMs using LangSmith, Argilla, and other open-source tools

### To-do
- Google Palm LLM (from LangChain integration) is generating an itinerary by assigning 2hrs for each activity. This should be changed.
- Compare different LLMs' responses on itinerary generation using the default prompt templates. Prefer open-source LLMs.

### Prompts

User Prompt
```
query = f""" Plan a trip to {destination} from {arrival_date} to {departure_date} with ${budget}. 
        Start the itinerary from {start_time} to {end_time} for each day. 
        Keep in mind that {additional_info}.
        """

template = f"""{query}. Consider weather and budget, and include an estimated cost for each activity. The timings for each activity should be realistic.
        Display the ititenary in the following format: '\n\nTrip to <country/city/place>\n\nDay 1: <weather>\n<time-to-visit><things to do> or <places to visit> : \\<estimated cost>\n<time-to-visit><things to do> or <places           to visit> : \\<estimated cost>\n<time-to-visit><things to do> or <places to visit> : \\<estimated cost>\n<time-to-visit><things to do> or <places to visit> : <estimated cost>....\n\nDay N: <weather>\n<time-to-visit>          <things to do> or <places to visit> : <estimated cost>\n<time-to-visit><things to do> or <places to visit> : <estimated cost>\n<time-to-visit><things to do> or <places to visit> : <estimated cost>\n<time-to-visit>            <things to do> or <places to visit> : <estimated cost>\n\nTotal Estimated Cost: <total estimated cost>\n\nEnjoy your Trip!!!' 
        Don't include extra information.

System Prompt
```

Be realistic, the places should exist and real. Include cost for each activity. \nThink about it step by step, use the tools to get weather data and generate an effective plan."
